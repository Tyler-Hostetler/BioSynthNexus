# Protein Analysis Tool

---
## Overview:
A graphical user interface to easily access and output protein data.

Extracts data from a 
**Genome Network Neighborhood (GNN)** SQLITE file
generated by the Genome neighborhood tool (GNT) from 
Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI) Tools.
For more information on generating the GNN see the 
[EFI website](https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/).

Extracts [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)
data for a given protein Accession ID (or from a list of IDs).

| BGC-PFam                    | Parent Accession ID                                  | Gets the PFams for each of the proteins within the BGC                                                                            |

| Accessions from BGC by PFam | Parent Accession ID(s)<br/> + PFam (Secondary Input) | Gets the Accession for the protein within each BGC with the selected PFam </br> Displays as 'Output Accession_(Parent Accession)' |

Note: The `Accessions from BGC by PFam` outputs as `Output Accession_(Parent Accession)`,
however if you use `Replace Input with Output`, only the Output Accession will be displayed

## GNN Extraction:
- Click the 'Upload' button to select your GNN *.sqlite file.
- Select your desired output (See **GNN Extractions** above for guidance)
- Fill the left text field, labelled 'Input', with respective input
- Click 'Search'
- Output will be displayed in the right text field, labelled 'Output'
- The text in the Output Box can be used as an Input by utilizing the 'Replace Input with Output' Button

## Usage example:
You have a GNN of the protein X, you want to search for all BGCs which contain proteins labelled with the PFam `PF13714`.
Then you would like to get the accession IDs associated with those PF13714 proteins that you just found.
Lastly, you would like the FASTA sequence for each of those proteins to compare.


#### Get the BGCs that contain the PFam PF13714
1. Upload the GNN generated for protein X
2. Enter the 'PF13714' into the input field
3. Select `Accession` as the Output Type
4. Click `Search`
   1. Displayed will be all parent accession which have BGCs that contain at least one protein associated with the given PFam

#### Get the Accession IDs for each of proteins associated with the PFam PF13714
1. Click `Replace Input with Output`
2. Enter 'PF13714' into the `Secondary Input` Field
3. Select `Accessions from BGC by PFam` as the Output Type
4. Click `Search`
   1. Displayed will be the Accession ID of each protein that is associated with (or contains) the PFam 'PF13714'
   2. In parentheses is the parent Accession ID (If one BGC contains multiple proteins with the given PFam they will be displayed on separate lines)

#### Get the FASTA for each of the proteins
1. Click `Replace Input with Output`
2. Select `FASTA` as the Output Type
3. Click `Search`
   1. It may take some time, depending on the number of accessions being searched (see the console)
   2. Displayed will be the FASTA Sequences for each of the proteins
   3. Some accession FASTAs may fail to be obtained, see the console for these failures


At anyone of these steps the Output can be saved to a text document.

Simply click `Save` and a window will appear allowing you select the directory you would like to save the file.
